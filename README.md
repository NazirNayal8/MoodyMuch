## What is MoodyMuch?
Modern edge-device technology has paved the way to creating a new world of applications, all encapsulated within a device that can be carried by hand.ðŸ“± We, as MoodyMuch, aim to create an application to track the mood and emotional changes of a person ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜Š

## Is it all?
No not at all! We then provide recommendations on activities that can improve the person's mood or emotional state. For instance, the user will be able to use either the front or back camera of their phone to record a video of their face, then the application would recognize the userâ€™s current mood in order to help in improving it.

## Anything else?
Sure! The application can also be used either for tracking the state of a person who is in need of continuous monitoring due to their inability to express their thoughts and emotions.
